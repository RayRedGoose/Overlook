# OVERLOOK HOTEL MANAGEMENT TOOL

### Designed and created by [Raisa Primerova](https://github.com/RayRedGoose)

## Overview

Overlook is a hotel management app that used for getting booking info or making new booking. This app was designed for two types of users: manager and customer.

Customers can see their own past and future bookings, total spent amount for all time or reserve a new room.

Manager can see occupied room percent for today, a number of available rooms (total and specific type) and total revenue for today and last two days.
